###### [Introducing Legacy Templates](https://github.com/joexn/Legacy-Templates)
Legacy is a lightweight, simple and modern UI framework.
Anyone can download Legacy and use it, all you need to do is head over the the downloads section of the website here, download the latest version then you can start creating your own site.

Legacy is built for anyone, if you either have a lot of knowledge on web design, or none at all.. You can use Legacy to create a neat looking site based on your design preferences.
<br />
Check out <https://legacy-framework.com> for examples and details.<br />

Legacy was made as a minimalistic approach to modern web design. Legacy 3 incoroprates everything that makes the web beautiful.
The colour scheme is from Google's Material Design, and the styles are flat and modern.
