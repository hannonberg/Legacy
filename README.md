###### I'm getting ready for the Legacy 3 release. This includes updating the GitHub and website. I've got to make sure everything is compatible and cross browser ready. All  files have been removed from the Dev branch until the next release because these files are redundant.
<br /><br /><br />

###### [Updates to Legacy and Downloads](http://joexn.com/blog/updates-to-legacys-updates-and-downloads/)
Legacy is a lightweight, simple and modern UI framework.

Some things have changed: With the Legacy 2 release all development has moved to the master branch. A better file layout is coming.
